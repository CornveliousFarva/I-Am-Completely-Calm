# I-Am-Completely-Calm
Relaxer App

## Motivation
For someone who gets easily tense, like me, taking a few minutes to calm down can be the difference between calmness and a major meltodwn. Using this app teaches the user to breathe, hold it in, and let it out.

Right now, what makes it stand out is that most relaxers use something calm as a picture. This one uses a more comical expression.

#### Anything else that seems useful

# Future Developments
1. Allow user to select how long to meditate.
2. Allow the user to select images or import their own. Some people do better calming down while they're laughing.
